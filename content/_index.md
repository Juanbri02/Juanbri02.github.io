{% side_picture(image = "\me.jpg", alt = "Graduation Picture") %} Hello
I'm Juan, a **Mathematics** and **Physics Engineering** student at [CFIS](https://cfis.upc.edu/en)-[UPC](https://upc.edu/en) in *Barcelona*. My academic intrests are broad, and lie between geometry, algebra, number theory, and mathematical physics. I have pursued research at institutions such as the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/) or [ICMAT](https://www.icmat.es/). This coming academic year I will be pursuing a graduate programme at [Paris Cité University](https://u-paris.fr/en/) supported by a [PGSM Master](https://sciencesmaths-paris.fr/en/pgsm-master) scholarship. Outside academia I am also intrested in diverse topics, such as computer science, philosophy, literature, cinema, and others which I hope I'll cover here.
