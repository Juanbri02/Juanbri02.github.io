I'm Juan, a **Mathematics** and **Physics Engineering** graduate student currently pursuing a M2 Master of Fundamental Mathematics at [IMJ-PRG](https://www.imj-prg.fr/), enrolled at [Université Paris Cité](https://u-paris.fr/) supported by a [PGSM Master](https://sciencesmaths-paris.fr/en/pgsm-master) scholarship. My academic intrests are broad, and lie between geometry, algebra, number theory, and mathematical physics. I studied my undergraduate degree at [CFIS](https://cfis.upc.edu/en)-[UPC](https://upc.edu/en) in *Barcelona*, and I have pursued research at institutions such as the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/) or [ICMAT](https://www.icmat.es/). Outside academia I am also intrested in diverse topics, such as computer science, philosophy, literature, cinema, and others which I hope I'll cover here.
