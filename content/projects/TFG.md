## About the project

I developed this project under the joint supervision of professor [Andrew Dancer](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/andrew.dancer) at the Mathematical Institute of the University of Oxford, and [Eva Miranda](https://web.mat.upc.edu/eva.miranda/nova/) at the [SYMCREA](https://sites.google.com/upc.edu/symcrea/) lab of the Polythecnic University of Catalonia during the 24/25 academic year. It covers topics on symplectic geometry, focusing on singular symplectic reduction.

The original submited for gradeding version can be found [here](https://upcommons.upc.edu/), but here you can find a later version that has been corrected and updated for clarity.
