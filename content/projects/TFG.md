Here you can find the latest version of my undergraduate thesis. The original, graded version can be found [here](https://upcommons.upc.edu/), but the version here presented has been corrected and updated for clarity.

### The project
I developed this project under the joint supervision of professor [Andrew Dancer](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/andrew.dancer) at the Mathematical Institute of the University of Oxford, and [Eva Miranda](https://web.mat.upc.edu/eva.miranda/nova/) at the [SYMCREA](https://sites.google.com/upc.edu/symcrea/) lab of the Polythecnic University of Catalonia. It covers topics of symplectic geometry, focusing on singular symplectic reduction.
